### General tips
- Recommended notation: algebraic
- A pause between piece and square
	- "Knight   d5"
- Sometimes also:
	- "Knight   d   5"
- If you have two pieces that can go into the same square, separate them with an emphasized pause in between
	- "Knight   f   e5"
- Always say the full destination square, also for pawn captures
	- "f e5" OR
	- "f takes e5"
- Use a high quality headset or microphone for optimal accuracy.

##### Other notation:
- UCI notation ("f6d5") is not supported, as piece information is needed

##### Warnings
- Avoid the fill words 'to' and 'on' as in "knight to g5". 
	- It can be mistaken for the number two
- Make sure that the moves you input are legal
	- Different techniques are used to optimize the recognition 
of the correct move in a given position. This can lead to a wrongly captured 
illegal move being translated as another move that is legal.
